## Lesson Learned


NLP enables computers to understand natural language as humans do. Whether the language is spoken or written, natural language processing uses artificial intelligence to take real-world input, process it, and make sense of it in a way a computer can understand.


In this Project, I have identified that random forest is giving 97% accuracy in spam classification of emails.
